## Notes
The frontend is made with Vue.js Options API and in HTML. It uses AJAX/Jquery to make polling request to the backend and update on changes.
The backend is Flask app that both serves the static files and implements the API for the different modules. It uses multithreading to run the different modules and communicate with them.
